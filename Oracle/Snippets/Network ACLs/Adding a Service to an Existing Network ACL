-- Adds an additional service to an existing Network ACL, expanding its covered service list.
--    Version: v1
--    Documentation:
--       Adding an additional service to an existing Network ACL does not require a database restart, etc.
--       You should have connectivity in all new sessions for the supported users and services going forward.

-- First, ensure that the Network ACL already exists.
SELECT *
  FROM dba_network_acls na
 ORDER BY na.acl, na.host;

-- Next, add the additional service host to the Network ACL.
BEGIN
  dbms_network_acl_admin.assign_acl(
    acl        => '<ACL_FILENAME>.xml',
    host       => '<ACL_HOST>',
    lower_port => NULL,
    upper_port => NULL
  );
END;
/

-- Finally, verify that the Network ACL now lists the additional service host.
SELECT *
  FROM dba_network_acls na
 ORDER BY na.acl, na.host;
