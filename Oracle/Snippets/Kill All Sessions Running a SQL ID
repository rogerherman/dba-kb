-- Kills all sessions running a specified SQL command.
--    Current Version: v1
--    Documentation:
--       1. There are two "kill" commands included in the output of this query.
--           a. "System_Kill" is intended to be run within a worksheet.
--           b. "OraKill" invokes the command line utility. As such, it needs to be run directly on the server hosting the database.
--       2. There is a control mechanism in this query to forcefully exclude any Oracle Maintained schemas. We don't want to accidentally kill a system process!
--       3. The SQL ID provided at the end of the query is a sample. Modify this to suit your needs.
--       4. The "username", "SID", and "SQL_ID" columns are included for sanity checking before you start killing sessions.

SELECT s.username, s.sid, s.sql_id,
       'ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION ''' || s.sid || ',' || s.serial# || ''';' AS system_kill, 
       'ORAKILL ' || sys_context('USERENV', 'DB_NAME') || ' ' || p.spid AS orakill
  FROM v$session s
  JOIN v$process p ON (p.addr = s.paddr)
 WHERE s.username NOT IN (SELECT u.username
                            FROM dba_users u
                           WHERE u.oracle_maintained = 'Y')
   AND s.sql_id = '46ubcf6fhr9ns'
 ORDER BY s.username, s.sid;
