-- Drops a tablespace from the database.
--    Current Version: v1
--    Documentation:
--        BE CERTAIN that you want to drop the tablespace and all of its contents!
--        You will need to replace the <TABLESPACE_NAME> tag with your tablespace name as needed.

-- Check to see if the tablespace is empty.
SELECT s.owner, s.segment_name 
  FROM dba_segments s
 WHERE s.tablespace_name = '<TABLESPACE_NAME>'
 ORDER BY s.owner, s.segment_name;

-- If the tablespace is empty, we can proceed with dropping it.
--     Otherwise, you need to ensure that it is fine for the associated objects to disappear as well.

-- Once the tablespace is empty or approvals are in place, drop the tablespace.
DROP TABLESPACE <TABLESPACE_NAME> INCLUDING CONTENTS AND DATAFILES;
