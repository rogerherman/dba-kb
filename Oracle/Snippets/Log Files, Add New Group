--       1. The PATH_TO_LOG_FILE placeholder will need to come form your environment.
--              a. In example, D:\Oracle\RedoLogs\REDO_01.log
--       2. The extension for the file is arbitrary. My organization chose to use ".log", so that
--              we can easily tell that it is a log file when viewing the file in the OS.
--       3. The GROUP# placeholder will need to be overwritten with the log file group # that you
--              want to add the new log file to.
--       4. The "4096M" size is provided as an example. Adjust this to match your needs.
