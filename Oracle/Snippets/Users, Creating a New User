-- Adds a new user to the database.
--    Version: v1
--    Documentation:
--       The following process is listed to act as a guide, not gospel. These are merely the steps
--       that I've chosen to follow, so that there is a repeatable, governing process for user creation.

-- ##   USERNAME   ##
-- First, unless you are directed to create a specific user, you need to decide on the user name.
--     In general, we want to avoid using needless prefixing (ie: "ABC_") unless it falls
--     into one of the below cases:
--         a. The user belongs to a third-party company/entity.
--             (ie: ABC_JSMITH, from consulting firm ABC)
--         b. The user is a "stub" user from another database ecosystem, to direct cross-DB traffic.
--             (ie: XYZ_FINANCIALS, where XYZ is a corporate unit; not just a singular DB)

-- ##   TABLESPACE   ##
-- Next, the user will need a default tablespace for their objects to be stored in.
--     a. If the user is for a PERSON, set their default tablespace as the USERS tablespace.
--     b. Otherwise, create a new tablespace for the user, so that they have a dedicated tablespace.

-- ##   PROFILE   ##
-- Thirdly, we need to consider the default profile that will be assigned to the user.
--     This will be different for each database ecosystem and may have been configured in advance.
--     In general, we use broad categories to help govern user profiles that fall into the following list:
--         a. DEFAULT - This is the default. Should not be used for new/custom users without good reason.
--         b. PERSON - This is a custom profile. We apply this profile to human beings (ie: not websites, etc).
--         c. WEBSITE - This is a custom profile, intended for website use.
--         *. There can be others that your database environment already has configured. Review the list
--             and see if there are any available options that make sense for your new user.

-- ##   SECURITY   ##
-- Finally, we need to set the new user's password. There are a few rules to follow here:
--     a. Our organization requires at least three of the basic password character types to be used in any
--         database passwords (upper case, lower case, numbers, symbols).
--     b. If the user being created is for a PERSON, it is safe to set the password to either a default
--         or single-use password, since they will be changing it upon receipt. Make sure to notify the
--         user about their credentials through a secure/encrypted channel.
--     c. If the user being created is NOT a PERSON (ie: more like a stub or service account), you will
--         want to ensure that the password does not match between all forms of the database. This
--         includes dev, test, prod, etc. If said service account password were to be leaked, we want to
--         minimize the attack vector as much as possible.

-- Once all of these considerations and pieces of information have been gathered, you can create the user.
CREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED BY <password> DEFAULT TABLESPACE <tablespace_name> PROFILE <profile_name>;
ALTER USER <username> GRANT QUOTA UNLIMITED ON <tablespace_name>;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO <username>;
