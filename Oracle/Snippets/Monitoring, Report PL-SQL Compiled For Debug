-- Reports all PL/SQL objects compiled for debug.
--    Current Version: v1
--    Documentation:
--       This version of the query relies on the custom Sysadmin.schemas table.
--       An updated version could instead exclude any Oracle managed schemas.
--       The focus of this report is to find debug PL/SQL in an environment where
--       slower running code would not be wanted, such as production.
