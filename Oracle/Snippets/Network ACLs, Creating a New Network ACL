-- Creates a new network ACL for database to service connectivity.
--    Version: v2
--    Documentation:
--       Network ACLs were required starting in Oracle 11g. Network ACLs need to be created to manage
--       access from the database to external services.

-- ##   CREATE NEW ACL LIST   ##
-- To allow connectivity to remote services, you will need to first create an Oracle Network ACL.
--     These control lists are then applied to the specific database users that need them, instead
--     of the whole database.
-- The file name can be used to better describe the ACLs usage, since it does not programmatically matter.
-- The ACL description field allows for further info to be added, since ACLs are often created and forgotten.
-- The "DB_USER_FOR_ACCESS" placeholder is the specific database user that needs to connect to the 
--     services that this ACL will cover.
BEGIN
  dbms_network_acl_admin.create_acl(
    acl         => '<ACL_FILENAME>.xml',
    description => '<ACL_DESCRIPTION>',
    principal   => '<DB_USER_FOR_ACCESS>',
    is_grant    => TRUE,
    privilege   => 'connect, resolve'
  );
END;

-- ##   ASSIGN ACL TO HOST   ##
-- Once the network ACL list has been created, you will need to assign host services or domains to it.
--     ie: portal.azure.com
-- The host parameter does support the "*" wildcard for portions of the domain.
--     ie: *.azure.com
--     IMPORTANT: While just passing "*" is valid, that means your ACL will evaluate to TRUE for ALL
--         requested services and connections. This heavily violates security and privilege principles.
--         Strongly urged to not use it, even in testing.
--  The lower and upper port parameters allow you to fine tune the host access, so that only specific
--      ports are allowed. In this example, we have provided NULL; the most common case.
BEGIN
  dbms_network_acl_admin.assign_acl(
    acl        => '<ACL_FILENAME>.xml',
    host       => '<ACL_HOST>',
    lower_port => NULL,
    upper_port => NULL
  );
END;
/

-- ##   VERIFY ACL APPLIED TO DATABASE USER   ##
-- You can verify that the new Network ACL has been applied to the database user through this query.
