-- Guides through the process of dropping and recreating a log file group, so that the size can be increased.
--    Current Version: v1
--    Documentation:
--       This version of the query relies on the custom Sysadmin.Schemas table. A future version 
--       of this query could be written to exclude Oracle managed schemas for the same effect.

-- Supporting Query: Report log file groups and their status
SELECT group#, status
  FROM v$log
 ORDER BY group#;

-- Step 1: Remove the log file group you want to resize.
--       WARNING: Make sure it's not CURRENT or ACTIVE! Can use the above supporting query to verify status.
alter database drop logfile group <GROUP#>;

-- Step 2: Delete the files on disk.
--       This is especially important if you plan on reusing the directory and file names afterwards.
--       Also better to do so, so that space is not needlessly being consumed.

-- Step 3: Add the new log file group and member(s)
--       The first command handles adding a new log file group to the database.
--            The "<GROUP#>" placeholder needs to be updated with your desired log file group #.
--            The size on the end of the command is provided as an example. Change the "4096M" size as needed.
--       The second command handles adding a multiplexed log file to the group.
--            This helps add additional members onto separate drives/folders to provide resilience.
--            This command can be run as many times as needed, assuming that the 
--                  "<OTHER_PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>" placeholder changes with it.
alter database add logfile group <GROUP#> '<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE.log>' size 4096M;
alter database add logfile member '<OTHER_PATH_TO_LOG_FILE.log>' to group <GROUP#>;

-- Step 4: Switch through the log groups, to ensure that there are no issues.
--       As a sanity check, you will want to switch through the active log file groups, so that
--            you can verify that the database can utilize your new log file group correctly. Otherwise,
--            you could have a database issue at an indeterminate time.
--       WARNING: Don't cycle through the log file groups too quickly, or you could cause a separate
--            issue, where there's no remaining log file groups to switch to while they're being
--            archived. Check the status of the log file groups as you cycle through. If it is
--            still being archived, the status will be "ACTIVE". Wait for all statuses to either be
--            "CURRENT" or "INACTIVE" before switching again.
alter system switch logfile;
