-- Invokes the "expdp" tool for Oracle, beginning a database export.
--    Version: v1
--    Documentation:
--       Corrupted blocks are populated when running the verify through RMAN.
--    Usage:
--       *. This is a command-line tool, to be used at the OS level that the database is running on.
--       1. Change the "rogerherman" username at the beginning of the command to the privileged user you need to run the export as.
--       2. The "schemas" section targets which schema you want to export. If you don't need a specific one, you can omit this clause.
--       3. The "directory" section denotes where to store the export. For our organization, we created a custom "DB_EXPORT_DIR". You can change this to your custom directory as needed.
--       4. The "dumpfile" section states what you want the export to be named. In this example, since we were exporting a single schema, we set the name to match for readability.
--       5. The "logfile" section provides a log file for you to direct the debug message to. In this example, since this is a schema export,
