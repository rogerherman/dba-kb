-- Reports any tables with stale stats and provides the DDL to regather statistics.
--    Current Version: v1
--    Documentation:
--       This version of the query relies on the custom Sysadmin.Schemas table. A future version 
--       of this query could be written to exclude Oracle managed schemas for the same effect.
