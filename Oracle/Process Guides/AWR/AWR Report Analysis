In general, apply the "Oracle Diagnostic" method:
1. Find the worst bottleneck.
2. Relieve it.
3. Repeat until performance is good enough.

Master Checklist
1. Implement any ADDM findings from the same snapshot interval.
2. Review overall picture from AWR header information.
3. Check Host and Instance CPU to determine proportion of CPU usage by the instance.
4. Check the Load Profile to use later as context for the Top Waits.
5. Examine the Top 5 Timed Events for highest resource consumption

Check for Serious CPU Over-Provisioning
1. Check the "Host CPU" section. Verify that the "%Idle" value is not near zero. 
    a. (0% is completely starved, 100% is no work being done.)
2. Check the "Load Profile" section. Verify that the "DB CPU(s)" value does not exceed the number of cores for the server.
    a. If reported DB CPU(s) is 22, but you only have 12 cores, then your system demand is 22 cores. You're short available CPUs.
