Prerequisites
1. You will need to have a login for Oracle Enterprise Manager with SUPER ADMINISTRATOR access.

Steps to Remove a Blackout
1. Navigate to the Blackouts page in OEM
    a. Enterprise -> Monitoring -> Blackouts
2. In the middle of the "Blackouts" page is a grid that will list all current blackouts.
3. Select the blackout from the list that you would like to remove.
    a. If you don't see the blackout that you expect, you may need to switch to displaying blackouts by name, instead of by targets.
4. Click on the "Stop" button. OEM will ask you to confirm that you wish to stop the blackout.
5. Once the blackout is stopped (you may need to hit the refresh button in OEM a few times to update the interface), select the blackout name again.
6. With the blackout selected, and confirmed as STOPPED, you can then click on the "Delete" button.
7. This will once again ask you confirm. Click "Delete" to confirm.
8. The blackout should now be removed from the list.
    a. This may take a few minutes to take effect, since it needs to contact the Oracle agents and the remote database to confirm.
