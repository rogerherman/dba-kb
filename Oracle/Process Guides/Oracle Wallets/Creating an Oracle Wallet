1. Log into the server that you want to create the Oracle Wallet in.
2. Launch the Oracle Wallet Manager (part of the Oracle client folder).
    a. Example path in the Start Menu ("Oracle - OraDB19Home1" -> "Wallet Manager")
3. In the Wallet Manager, use the top menu and select "Wallet" -> "New".
4. If you receive an error stating that the default wallet directory does not exist, you can ignore it.
5. The "New Wallet" popup will help guide the next step:
    a. Generate a new password for the wallet. Provide it here.
    b. For the wallet type, "Standard" is fine.
6. You may receive a prompt asking about certificate requests. Skip this for now.
7. The wallet has been successfully created, but not saved. Save the wallet to our custom default directory in its own subfolder.
    a. ie: C:\Oracle\Wallets\LDAP
    b. ie: C:\Oracle\Wallets\Graph API
