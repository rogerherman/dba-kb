-- Reports any indexes that are invalid. Includes index partitions in results.
--    Current Version: v1
--    Documentation:
--       Along with the reported invalid indexes, this query returns the DDL needed to 
--       rebuild them. Includes support for index subpartitions as well.
--       This version of the query relies on the custom Sysadmin.Schemas table. A future version 
--       of this query could be written to exclude Oracle managed schemas for the same effect.
