-- Generates the DDL to enable/disable database-level triggers.
--    Current Version: v1
--    Documentation:
--       This version of the query relies on the custom Sysadmin.Schemas table.
--       A future version of this query could exclude Oracle managed schemas
--       for largely the same effect. Programmer and Third Party flags are 
--       consulted as well, but those could be ignored if not applicable to DB.
