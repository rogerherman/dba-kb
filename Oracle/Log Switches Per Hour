-- Reports the log switches that occurred within the last hour.
--    Current Version: v1
--    Documentation:
--       This is being used as a metric for undersized or overactive logs.
--       If there are no switches within the last hour, the logs are too large for timely recovery.
--       However, if the logs switch too many times, your system is either overactive or poorly sized.
--       Ideally, you want 3-4 log switches per hour under load. Will need to consider time of year,
--       if the metrics are low, etc.
